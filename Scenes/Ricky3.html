        <h2>Ricky - 7:29 PM</h2>
        <br><br>

        <p>
        When he was finally feeling good enough to get up, he unlocked the bathroom door and stumbled out. Ricky was greeted by a line of angry women.<br><br>

        “Sorry,” he mumbled as he ran back to where Mark was sitting.<br><br>

        “What the fuck? The men’s bathroom has no line and you choose to use the women’s bathroom??” he heard shouting coming from behind him.<br><br>

        “Oh, hi Mark,” Ricky said, now back at the table. A closer look revealed that Mark was crying.<br><br>

        “Oh God. What happened? Are you okay?” Ricky asked, hoping that Natalie hadn’t revealed everything while he was gone.<br><br>

        “Diego and Natalie just left together, and they’re probably having sex or something right now. Diego is constantly having sex. But Natalie was MY GIRLFRIEND!” Mark sobbed.<br><br>

        “Oh, Mark,” Ricky was relieved. Natalie had made this so easy for him to fix. “Here, take Diego’s drink and just start drinking. Let’s both get in line and get a couple flights.”<br><br>

        “Okay,” Mark moped as a stood up.<br><br>

        It seems like Mark is going to blackout again tonight. Ricky put his arm around his shoulder as he slowly muddled Mark’s mind, erasing the night.<br><br></p>
