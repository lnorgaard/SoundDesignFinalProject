        <h2>Ricky - 7:29 PM</h2>
        <br><br>

        <p>
        When he was finally feeling good enough to get up, he unlocked the bathroom door and stumbled out. The bathroom behind him was left spotless. In fact, the bathroom floor was probably cleaner than the blood in his veins. Ricky was greeted by a line of angry women.<br><br>

        “Sorry,” he mumbled as he ran back to where Mark was sitting. He heard shouting coming from behind him.<br><br>

        “Oh, hi Mark,” Ricky said, now back at the table where there was a clear absence of Natalie and Diego. A closer look revealed that Mark was crying.<br><br>

        “Oh God. What happened? Are you okay?” Ricky asked, hoping that Natalie hadn’t revealed anything while he was gone. Tonight wasn't best the night to explain the world to Mark. <br><br>

        “Diego and Natalie just left together, and they’re probably having sex or something right now. Diego is always having sex. But Natalie was MY GIRLFRIEND!” Mark sobbed.<br><br>

        “Oh, Mark,” Ricky was relieved. Natalie had made this so easy for him to fix. “Here, take Diego’s drink and just start drinking. Let’s both get in line and get a couple flights.”<br><br>

        “Okay,” Mark moped as a stood up.<br><br>

        It seems like Mark is going to blackout again tonight. Tracking Diego and Natalie down would be incredibly difficult with Mark around. Ricky put his arm around his shoulder as he slowly muddled Mark’s mind, erasing the night.<br><br></p>
