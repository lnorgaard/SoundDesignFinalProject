        <p>Natalie was nervous to finally meet Mark’s friends for the first time. Tonight, they would be hanging out at the popular brewery in Strooptown. Mark — whom Natalie had been dating for the last three weeks — constantly talked about his two best friends. Even without meeting them, she already knew almost everything about Ricky and Diego, including some weird, personal details. <i class="em em-grimacing"></i> This was partially because Mark talked so much around Natalie. <i class="em em-zipper_mouth_face"></i> And when he ran out of things about himself to talk about, his default topic was his two friends.<br><br>

        When Natalie got nervous, she calmed herself down by french braiding her long, dark hair. She took the neat braid and twisted it into a bun, held it in place with her right hand for a couple of seconds, and then let it loose, shaking her head back and forth. <i class="em em-rose"></i> She did this as Mark arrived outside her house.<br><br>

        Through her window, she watched as Mark parked his silver Prius next to the curb, got out of the driver’s seat, and scampered around the front of the car to the passenger’s side. Smiling, he opened the car door and waited right there for Natalie to leave the house. A middle-aged woman walking her dog on the sidewalk picked up her pace as she passed Mark. Rolling her eyes, Natalie closed the curtains and strolled back to the kitchen to make some Kraft mac-n-cheese. Mark wasn’t supposed to be here for another 30 minutes.<br><br></p>
