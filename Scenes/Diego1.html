        <h2>Diego - 7:02 PM</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Diego sat down with his apricot blonde ale. Next to him at the table, Ricky gave him a smirk. Ricky could tell that Diego just had sex right before getting here, and Diego could tell that Ricky could tell.<br><br>

        “Do you have something you wanna say?” Diego asked.<br><br>

        “You could at least fix your hair.”<br><br>

        “Right. That probably made it pretty obvious.”<br><br>

        Diego focused all of his attention on one of the bricks on the red wall across from them. He clenched his teeth as he stared intently. The individual hairs on his head started to move back into place, the longer hairs on top untangling with each other. A layer of clay applied itself to his hair, adding a little shine and holding everything in place. Diego gave a final grunt, focusing so hard that a vein popped out on his left temple. A cloud of light, elegant cologne came out of nowhere and sprinkled itself onto his head.<br><br>

        “Was that last part really necessary?” Ricky raised his eyebrow.<br><br>

        “Dude, my hair is my only superpower, and I’m going to use it to its full potential. So how about you fuck off, Mr. I-Have-Literally-Every-Superpower-Ever.”<br><br>

        “Get yourself together. Mark is coming.” <button id="emojiF"><i class="em em-hankey" title="Mark has no powers. Ricky and Diego know that Mark has no powers. Mark does not know that he has no powers. Mark does not know that powers exist."></i></button> <br><br>

        Mark and Natalie walked over to their table, hand in hand.<br><br>

        “Natalie, this is Ricky and Diego. Guys, this is Natalie.”<br><br>

        Diego reached his hand out to greet her. As their hands met, her soft, moisturized skin sent his mind flying back an hour. He pictured Jordan’s soft hands roaming across his chest. Jordan flashed him his classic smoulder, his blue eyes glistening in the sunlight that shone through the window. He felt goosebumps as Jordan used his manicured nails to slowly scratch a light trail from his upper chest all the way down to the top of his salmon pants.<br><br>

        Ricky kicked Diego’s foot under the table.<br><br>

        Diego snapped back to reality, and his vision refocused. On Natalie’s cleavage. Her light caramel skin — and those 36D’s <button id="emojiG"><i class="em em-watermelon" title="Diego may only have one superpower, but he has a 6th sense! He can tell what a woman’s correct bra size is instantly."></i></button> — reminded him of Jordan’s fantastic ass. The way it stayed perfectly round even when he bent over, and the way that Chinese character tattooed on his left shoulder blade danced when he tensed up his muscles...<br><br>

        Natalie squeezed his hand as hard as she could, and Diego finally woke up from his daydream.<br><br>

        <i>Shit! How long was I out?</i><br><br></p>
