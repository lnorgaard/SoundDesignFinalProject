        <p>Mark was nervous about Natalie meeting his friends for the first time. She had been asking to meet Ricky and Diego for the past three weeks. Normally, Mark would leap at any opportunity to show off the fact that he did actually have friends. However, Natalie was different. She was the first girl to ever agree to go out with him. In fact, it was Natalie who asked Mark out. <i class="em em-heartbeat"></i> He couldn’t risk losing her, and if anything, meeting his friends might scare her off.<br><br>

        Diego was a notorious ladies man. His hair was irritatingly perfect, and it made Mark mad. Diego once ran a marathon and crossed the finish line with his hair still completely intact. <i class="em em-man-gesturing-ok"></i> Out of the two, Diego would definitely be the one to steal Natalie away. Ricky, on the other hand, tended to be dark and brooding. Ever since his brother disappeared a couple years ago, Ricky had completely changed his style, and he’d been on the edge, searching for clues as to what happened. He also tended to encourage excessive drinking. The last ten times Mark drank with Ricky, he’d blacked out and had no recollection of the occasion.<br><br>

        Mark shook off these thoughts as he parked the car in the brewery parking lot. Glancing over at Natalie, he asked, “Ready?” The two got out of the Prius and walked towards the table where Ricky and Diego were sitting.<br><br>

        “Natalie, this is Ricky and Diego. Guys, this is Natalie.” Mark watched as Ricky nodded his head once in Natalie’s direction. Diego reached out to shake Natalie’s hand and proceeded to fixate… on her chest. And he continued to shake her hand and fixate on her chest. He did not stop shaking her hand and fixating on her chest.<br><br></p>
