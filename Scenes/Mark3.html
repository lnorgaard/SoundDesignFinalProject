        <p>Mark grabbed his tacos from the truck’s pickup window and dropped $20 into the tip jar. He sat back down at the table, but not before tripping over one of the legs on his chair. Being careful not to spill anything on his brand-new striped polo shirt or his beloved khaki shorts, Mark leaned over the table and took a bite of his carne asada taco.<br><br>

        Oh no. A handful of salsa slid down his polo. Mark quickly grabbed a napkin and rubbed it in. Maybe I should just stop eating and wait for the beer. I don’t want my breath to smell too bad when Natalie gets back.<br><br>

        He did a quick breath check, blowing out a small puff of air into his right hand and sniffing it. All good. <i class="em em-mask" title="No. Not all good. You usually can’t smell your own breath."></i> <br><br>

        Mark placed his hands in his lap, rocking back and forth as he waited for his friends to return.<br><br></p>
