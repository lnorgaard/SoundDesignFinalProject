        Mark grabbed his tacos from the truck’s pickup window and dropped $20 into the tip jar.<br><br>

        He sat back down at the table, but not before tripping over one of the legs on his chair. Being careful not to spill anything on his brand-new striped polo shirt or his beloved khaki shorts, Mark leaned over the table and took a bite of his carne asada taco.<br><br>

        <i>Oh no.</i> A handful of salsa slid down his polo.<br><br>

        Mark quickly grabbed a napkin and rubbed it in. <i>Maybe I should just stop eating and wait for the beer. I don’t want my breath to smell too bad when Natalie gets back.</i><br><br>

        He did a quick breath check, blowing out a small puff of air into his right hand and sniffing it. <i>All good.</i> <button id="emojiK"><i class="em em-mask" title="No. Not all good. You usually can’t smell your own breath."></i></button> <br><br>

        Mark placed his hands in his lap, rocking back and forth as he waited for his friends to return.<br><br></p>
