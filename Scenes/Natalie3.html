        <h2>Natalie - 7:26 PM</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Desperate to find Diego and leave, Natalie went back to the table, where she found only Mark.<br><br>

        “Where did everyone go?” she asked.<br><br>

        “Well Diego went to the bathroom. And you and Ricky went to get us some beers… did you get any beer? Where is Ricky?”<br><br>

        “Oh, Ricky is still in line to get the drinks. The line is suuuuper long.”<br><br>

        “But you just asked where everyone was. Were you just curious about Diego?” Mark probed.<br><br>

        “What? Well, I’m gonna go back and help Ricky with the beers now,” Natalie said as backed away from the table.<br><br>

        “Okay! I treasure you! <button id="emojiL"><i class="em em-cold_sweat" title="Mark tells her that he treasures/adores/worships/etc. her every day. She has never said it back."></i></button> Diego’s not that great! He hooks up with every girl he meets!”<br><br>

        Natalie fast-walked towards the bathroom again, where she saw Diego leaving the men’s room.<br><br>

        “You’re coming with me,” Natalie said as she pulled Diego towards the back exit.<br><br>

        “Whoa, where are we going?” asked Diego, pulling in the other direction.<br><br>

        “I wanna show you something,” Natalie said.<br><br>

        “Listen, I’m sorry that I stared at you earlier. I’m not into you or anything,” Diego said.<br><br>

        “Don’t make this difficult for me. Just come,” Natalie said, pulling again.<br><br>

        “Where are we going? This is super weird.”<br><br>

        Deciding that she'd had enough, Natalie placed her hand on the back of Diego's head and closed her eyes, focusing. Diego's muscles loosened slightly, his pupils doubled in size, and he followed Natalie out the back exit.<br><br></p>
