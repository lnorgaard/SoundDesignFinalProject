        <h2>Natalie - 7:26 PM</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Desperate to find Diego and leave, Natalie went back to the table, where she found only Mark.<br><br>

        “Where did everyone go?” she asked.<br><br>

        “Well Diego went to the bathroom. And you and Ricky went to get us some beers… did you get any beer? Where is Ricky?”<br><br>

        “Oh, Ricky is still in line to get the drinks. The line is suuuuper long.”<br><br>

        “But you just asked where everyone was. Were you just curious about Diego?” Mark probed.<br><br>

        “What? Well, I’m gonna go back and help Ricky with the beers now,” Natalie said as backed away from the table.<br><br>

        “Okay! I treasure you! <i class="em em-cold_sweat" title="Mark tells her that he treasures/adores/worships/etc. her every day. She has never said it back."></i> Diego’s not that great! He hooks up with every girl he meets!”<br><br>

        Natalie fast-walked towards the bathroom again, where she saw Diego leaving the men’s room.<br><br>

        “You’re coming with me,” Natalie said as she pulled Diego towards the back entrance.<br><br>

        “Whoa, where are we going?” asked Diego, pulling in the other direction.<br><br>

        “I wanna show you something,” Natalie said.<br><br>

        “Listen, I’m sorry that I stared at you earlier. I’m not into you or anything,” Diego said.<br><br>

        “Don’t make this difficult for me. Just come,” Natalie said, pulling again.<br><br>

        “Where are we going? This is super weird.”<br><br>

        With that, Natalie was forced to brainwash Diego. His muscles loosened slightly, his pupils doubled in size, and he followed Natalie out the back entrance.<br><br></p>
