        <h2>Natalie - 7:12 PM</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>“Julia,” Ricky said, catching Natalie off guard.<br><br>

        What. The. F---. How does Ricky remember my last identity? Natalie had been very careful in her previous mission. She had made sure to brainwash everyone she interacted with before taking Jon away. Ricky was going to ruin everything if she let him go, and apparently she couldn’t just brainwash him again because it didn’t exactly work the last time.<br><br>

        Natalie snatched Ricky by the collar and threw him into the women’s restroom, locking the door behind them.<br><br>

        “Listen, you little shit. I can’t let you go this time because you insist on getting in my way. So I’ll just have to kill you.”<br><br>

        “Wait! Won’t Mark notice if his best friend is suddenly, you know, NOT ALIVE?”<br><br>

        “You think I care?” said Natalie, “I’m here to find the so-called ‘Chosen-One’, and I’m pretty sure I’ve found him. And when I bring him back with me, I’ll just brainwash Mark. Or you know what? I don’t even have to brainwash him! That’s how clueless he is!”<br><br>

        “Wow. Wowwwww. I’m not even going to comment on that last part. Wait, who do you think the ‘Chosen One’ is?”<br><br>

        “Diego.”<br><br>

        “DIEGO! HA!” Ricky managed to spit out before he started choking.<br><br>

        “I’ve had enough of you,” Natalie said as she forced Ricky against the wall without touching him. Every limb in Ricky’s body turned white as all of his bodily fluids rushed to his head. His eyes bulged in their sockets, and thick, red liquid gushed from his mouth.<br><br>

        Natalie gagged in disgust, dropping him on the ground. She fled from the restroom, locking the door from the inside.<br><br></p>
