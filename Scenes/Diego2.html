        <h2>Diego - 7:20 PM</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>“Why are they taking so long? Sorry to leave you here buddy, but I need to use the restroom,” Diego said to Mark.<br><br>

        “Yeah, sure. Go do what you need to do.”<br><br>

        “Go get yourself some tacos or something.”<br><br>

        “I will. I will,” Mark said.<br><br>

        Diego got up from his seat and trotted over to the restroom. There was a long line for the women’s restroom but no line for the men’s restroom, as usual. <i class="em em-unamused" title="There is never a line for the men’s restroom. I’m not bitter. You’re bitter."></i> <br><br>
