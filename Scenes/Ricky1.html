        <h2>Ricky - 7:06 PM</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Ricky kicked Diego under the table. This was just typical Diego. But there was something off about Natalie, too. Her face was awfully familiar, but Ricky couldn’t tell where he knew her from. He wondered if she could’ve been part of Jon’s disappearance, but he didn’t want to jump to conclusions. This was Mark’s first girlfriend, after all. Then again, the fact that she agreed to be his girlfriend in the first place made her very suspicious. No offense, Mark.<br><br>

        Right before Mark’s head exploded from rage, Natalie crushed Diego’s hand and pulled it away from him. She then braided her hair and twirled it into a bun before letting it loose again.<br><br>

        <i>OH. MY. GOD. IT’S HER! IT’S THE DEVIL WOMAN!</i> <button id="emojiI"><i class="em em-imp" title="A bit of an exaggeration. Natalie isn’t quite the “devil woman.” That would be Mary Ann Cotton, Natalie’s idol."></i></button> The memories that had been brainwashed out of Ricky came flooding back. He remembered Natalie — or Julia, the name she went by at the time — dragging Jon out of the house into a black van before speeding down the street and vanishing from his life. She also used to have that weird habit with her hair. Natalie was a headhunter, which meant she wasn’t here for Mark at all. Ricky had to stop her this time.<br><br>

        “Hey, Natalie. Why don’t we go get some beer for you and Mark?” Ricky suggested.<br><br>

        Natalie squinted at him before saying, “Sure.”<br><br>

        The two got into the ordering line.<br><br>

        “Listen, I know who you are. What are you up to? Because I’m pretty sure you’re not into Mark.”<br><br>

        “Excuse me? I just met you.”<br><br>

        “Julia.”<br><br>

        Natalie froze. Ricky had her right where he wanted her.<br><br></p>
