        Ricky groaned as his bodily fluids crawled up his chin and back into his mouth. As much as he was glad that he had regenerative powers, it was still painful. He curled up on the floor waiting for his body to regain its usual color. <button id="emojiM"><i class="em em-biohazard_sign" title="If Ricky didn't have herpes before, he probably has herpes now."></i></button><br><br>

        As his consciousness slowly returned, Ricky remembered the events that just occurred. After Jon disappeared two summers ago, Diego and Ricky created a plan for if something similar ever happened again. Both of them agreed to get tracking devices inserted so that they could keep track of each other at all times.<button id="emojiN"><i class="em em-snail" title="The procedure is pretty painful, so Diego and Ricky needed to be knocked out for the device insertion surgery. Ricky thought it would be funny to pay a little extra to have Diego's scar be made in the shape of a snail."></i></button> Deep down, Ricky was grateful that Natalie was after Diego so that he could finally locate Jon again.<br><br></p>
